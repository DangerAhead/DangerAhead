Disaster Management
Response to disaster normally happens after it develops into a disaster, like an extreme rainfall event developing into a flood. People ignore the stage wise development of the disaster which is very important. We need ways and means to monitor the development of a disaster which can be achieved best by the use of network of sensors(based on IOT) like water level sensors in case of a flood. Once it reaches a danger level they send out information to a central hub. Once this information reaches us, the app will notify civillians and decision-makers(like army, disaster management center)so they can act immediately. 

The most important thing in a disaster is to survive till the rescue arrives. We propose to make an app which guides people to reach the nearest safe buildings which are pre-registered in the app through a map. Other features include basic instructions to survive (when a disaster hits) will pop up so that people can follow them to be safe. It also has a feature to call (SOS) the disaster management center. The army can reach specific area to rescue using this App.

As soon as the disaster occurs the affected can press the "in a disaster" button which notifies all the relatives and friends which they are registered with when they make an account in the beginning. 

Also it will be having a donation platform which will be pretty effective as the notified relatives or friends will be more keen to help them out(rather than strangers) and organising also becomes a lot easier.Legit NGOs will be registered who can ues these funds  to reach the needy and anyone willing to volunteer can join them through this platform.

This app can be used by both civillians and decision makers.
